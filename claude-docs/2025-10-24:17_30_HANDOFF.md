# Session Handoff Document
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Time:** 17:30
**Project:** Home Craft Studio - 3D Apartment Viewer

---

## Session Overview

This session implemented a complete frontend polygon extrusion system with multiple 3D view modes for the apartment viewer application. We transitioned from loading pre-generated GLB files to performing real-time polygon extrusion on the frontend using Babylon.js.

---

## Major Achievements

### 1. Frontend Polygon Extrusion System
- **Created:** `frontend/src/utils/polygonExtrusion.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manual 3D geometry generation from 2D polygon coordinates
- **Key Functions:**
  - `create2DPolygon()` - Flat polygons for Plan view and floor surfaces
  - `create3DExtrudedPolygon()` - 3D extruded meshes for walls/openings
  - `getColorForType()` - Color mapping for different element types
  - `getAlphaForType()` - Transparency settings (windows at 80%)

### 2. Three View Modes Implementation
Implemented in `ApartmentViewer.tsx`:
- **Plan Mode**: 2D orthographic top-down view (initial default)
- **Perspective Mode**: 3D view with perspective projection
- **Isometric Mode**: 3D view with orthographic projection

### 3. Backend Polygon Endpoint
- **Added:** `/apartment/{apartment_id}/polygons` endpoint in `backend/app/main.py`
- **Returns:** JSON with polygon coordinates, elevations, and heights
- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "apartment_id": "string",
    "areas": [...],      // Room floor polygons
    "separators": [...], // Walls
    "openings": [...]    // Doors and windows
  }
  ```

### 4. Camera System Improvements
- Fixed orthographic camera aspect ratio handling
- Custom mouse wheel zoom for orthographic modes
- Proper viewport scaling to prevent stretching artifacts
- Camera controls: wheel zoom, left-drag rotate, right-drag pan

### 5. Visual Enhancements
- Self-illuminating materials (emissive colors) for all elements
- Windows: white, 80% opacity, self-lit
- Doors: brown, 100% opacity, self-lit
- Rooms/Walls: colored with 50% emissive brightness
- Z-layering in 2D mode: areas (0), walls (0.001), openings (0.002)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Geometry Building Approach

**Initial Problem:** Babylon.js `ExtrudePolygon()` works in XOZ plane and extrudes along Y-axis, but our coordinate system uses Z-up.

**Solution:** Manual geometry construction directly in Z-up orientation:
1. Triangulate 2D polygon using earcut
2. Create bottom face vertices at `elevation`
3. Create top face vertices at `elevation + height`
4. Generate side wall triangles connecting bottom and top
5. Compute normals automatically

**Key Code (polygonExtrusion.ts:69-156):**
```typescript
// Bottom face vertices (at elevation)
coordinates.forEach(([x, y]) => {
  positions.push(x, y, elevation);
});

// Top face vertices (at elevation + height)
coordinates.forEach(([x, y]) => {
  positions.push(x, y, elevation + height);
});

// Side faces
for (let i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {
  const next = (i + 1) % numVertices;
  indices.push(i, next, i + numVertices);
  indices.push(next, next + numVertices, i + numVertices);
}
```

### Rendering Strategy by View Mode

**Plan Mode (2D):**
- All elements rendered as flat polygons at Z=0
- Grid hidden to avoid obscuring floor plan
- Z-layering for proper selection: areas → walls → openings

**3D Modes (Perspective/Isometric):**
- **Areas (rooms):** Flat polygons at elevation (floor surfaces)
- **Separators (walls):** Extruded from elevation to elevation+height
- **Openings (doors/windows):** Extruded with proper heights
- Grid shown as reference plane at Z=-0.5

### Camera Configuration

**Orthographic Mode (BabylonScene.tsx:50-57, 65-87):**
```typescript
camera.mode = Camera.ORTHOGRAPHIC_CAMERA;
const aspectRatio = engine.getRenderWidth() / engine.getRenderHeight();
camera.orthoLeft = -size * aspectRatio;
camera.orthoRight = size * aspectRatio;
camera.orthoBottom = -size;
camera.orthoTop = size;
```

**Custom Zoom Handler:**
- Prevents default wheel behavior
- Scales ortho bounds by 10% per scroll
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Clamps zoom range: 2-100 units

## Important Notes for Next Session

### Environment Setup
- **Python environment:** `home-craft-studio` (conda)
- **Working directory:** `/home/peo/pogonal/labor/home-craft-studio`
- **Data file location:** Project root (excluded via .gitignore)
- **Backend runs on:** http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend runs on:** http://localhost:5173

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **No rotation transformations:** Geometry built directly in Z-up to avoid matrix conflicts
2. **Areas always flat:** Floor polygons never extruded, even in 3D modes
3. **Emissive colors everywhere:** Makes lighting-independent appearance
4. **Aspect ratio critical:** Must maintain for orthographic cameras
5. **Z-layering in 2D:** Small offsets (0.001) ensure proper rendering order

### Code Patterns to Follow
- Always use `create2DPolygon()` for floors
- Always use `create3DExtrudedPolygon()` for vertical elements (walls, openings)
- Always set `material.emissiveColor` for consistent brightness
- Always compute aspect ratio when setting ortho bounds
- Always make meshes double-sided: `mesh.sideOrientation = Mesh.DOUBLESIDE`

---

## Debugging Tips

### Common Issues

**Meshes appear flat when they should be 3D:**
- Check that `create3DExtrudedPolygon()` is being called, not `create2DPolygon()`
- Verify height values in data are non-zero

**Stretching when rotating camera:**
- Check aspect ratio is being calculated and applied to ortho bounds
- Ensure orthoLeft/Right use `size * aspectRatio`, orthoBottom/Top use just `size`

**Elements not visible:**
- Check emissive color is set (makes material self-lit)
- Verify Z-position isn't below grid (Z < -0.5)
- Check material alpha isn't 0

**Selection not working:**
- Ensure metadata is attached to mesh
- Check mesh.isPickable is true (default)
- Verify ground plane has `isPickable = false`

**Colors too dark:**
- Increase emissive color scale (currently 0.5)
- Add more scene lighting
